% PLOT_LINE Program which plots a line between complex points
%   The program plots a line between the complex points given in a vector.
%
%   VARIABLES
%   zfrom - start point of line (complex vector)
%   zto - end point of line (complex vector)
%   plot_prop - plotting properties, e.g. 'black .-' (string)
%   ln_wdth - line width (double)
